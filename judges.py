Your team has been retained by the director of a competition who supervises a 
panel of judges. The competition asks the judges to assign integer scores to 
competitors â€“ the higher the score, the better. Although the event has 
standards for what score values mean, each judge is likely to interpret 
those standards differently. A score of 100, say, may mean different things 
to different judges.

The director's main objective is to determine which competitors should 
receive prizes for the top positions. Although absolute scores may differ 
from judge to judge, the director realizes that relative rankings provide 
the needed information â€“ if two judges rank the same competitors first, 
second, third, ... then they agree on who should receive the prizes.

Your team is to write a program to assist the director by comparing the 
scores of pairs of judges. The program is to read two lists of integer 
scores in competitor order and determine the highest ranking place (first 
place being highest) at which the judges disagree.
