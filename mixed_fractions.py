You are part of a team developing software to help students learn basic mathematics. 
You are to write one part of that software, which is to display possibly improper 
fractions as mixed fractions. A proper fraction is one where the numerator is 
less than the denominator; a mixed fraction is a whole number followed by a 
proper fraction. For example the improper fraction 27/12 is equivalent to the 
mixed fraction 2 3/12. You should not reduce the fraction (i.e. donâ€™t 
change 3/12 to 1/4).
